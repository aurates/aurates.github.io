# AI Generated Personal Landing Page Demo </3

This project is fully powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**, an advanced AI model that conceptualized, designed, and implemented every aspect of this digital home.

Other than this sentence, I didn't write a single word of code. Even this README.md is AI generated.

A minimalist personal landing page featuring a "Liquid Glass" aesthetic with animated backgrounds and hidden view switching.

## Design Philosophy

- **Glassmorphism**: Translucent panels with backdrop blur create depth without visual clutter
- **Hidden Interactions**: Complex features accessible via tap patterns (3x space = Clock view)
- **Ambient Motion**: Floating bubbles and snow effects add life without distraction
- **Progressive Entrance**: Elements scale up from 85% opacity for a dimensional feel

## Core Features

- 🎨 Light/Dark theme with cookie persistence (defaults to light)
- ⏰ Hidden Clock view (3x spacebar/tap to toggle)
- ❄️ Toggleable snow effect (dark mode only)
- 🫧 Animated bubble background
- 📱 Fully responsive design
